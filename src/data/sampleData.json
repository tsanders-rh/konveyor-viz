          "description": "Remote EJBs are not supported in Quarkus, and therefore its use must be removed and replaced with REST functionality. In order to do this:\n 1. Replace the `@Remote` annotation on the class with a `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(\"<endpoint>\")` annotation. An endpoint must be added to the annotation in place of `<endpoint>` to specify the actual path to the REST service.\n 2. Remove `@Stateless` annotations if present. Given that REST services are stateless by nature, it makes it unnecessary.\n 3. For every public method on the EJB being converted, do the following:\n - In case the method has no input parameters, annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET`; otherwise annotate it with `@jakarta.ws.rs.POST` instead.\n - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(\"<endpoint>\")` and give it a proper endpoint path. As a rule of thumb, the method name can be used as endpoint, for instance:\n ```\n @Path(\"/increment\")\n public void increment() \n ```\n - Add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam(\"<param-name>\")` to any method parameters if needed, where `<param-name>` is a name for the parameter.",
